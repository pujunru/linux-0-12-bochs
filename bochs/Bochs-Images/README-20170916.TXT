To fix the "vga-update-interval not found" error:
Comment out (using '#' symbol) or delete the following lines:
#vga_update_interval: 300000	


Incompatible issues with recent Bochs version (2.4.x)

The bochs image files collected in this directory are built several years ago.
They can be ran normally under Buchs 2.2.X version. But when you use these image
files under one of the recent high Bochs verions, you may encounter some incompatible
problems when using those old  *.bxrc with them. 

The fix method is easy. Just modify the *.bxrc file as following: 

1. Modify the "romimage" line to the exact like this:
	romimage: file=$BXSHARE/BIOS-bochs-latest

2. Modify the "vgaromimage" line like this: 
	vgaromimage: file = $BXSHARE/VGABIOS-lgpl-latest

3. Comment out or delete the following lines:
	#parport1: enable=0
  	#floppy_command_delay: 50000
  	#ips: 4000000
  
That's all!


Problem when run with the newer Bochs software and fixing methods
-----------------------------------------------------------------

When running the Linux kernel 0.1x in Bochs environment with version number
newer or equal to 2.2.6, you may encounter an problem at the bootstrap period
with the error message "HD controller not ready". There are two general 
methods you can use to fix this problem. 

1. One way is tricky but easy and without modify the kernel code. you need 
only copy the harddisk image file to another name and modify the .bxrc file
to attach it as a second or slave hd in it. Fox example, if you have a hard
disk image file with name is hdc-0.11.img, just copy it to produce another 
disk image with a name something like hdd-0.11.img. Then modify 
the corresponding configuration file, for example, bochsrc-hd.bxrc. Add the 
following line, and the parameters in the line should be the same with your
hdc-0.11.img line. Then you can go with the newer bochs system.

ata0-slave: type=disk, path="hdd-0.11.img", mode=flat, cylinders=410, heads=16, spt=38


2. The second mothod is to modify the linux/kernel/blk_drv/hd.c file in you 
Linux kernel 0.11. Change the code at line 163 and 165:

163 int retries=10000;
164
165 while (--retries && (inb_p(HD_STATUS)&0xc0)!=0x40); 

as following:

163int retries=100000;
164
165while (--retries && (inb_p(HD_STATUS)&0x80)); 

then rebuild the kernel and write it to the boot floppy image file:

dd if=Image of=/dev/fd0


(End)
